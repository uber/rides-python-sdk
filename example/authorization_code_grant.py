"""Initializes an UberRidesClient with OAuth 2.0 Credentials.

This example demonstrates how to get an access token through the
OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant and use credentials to create
an UberRidesClient.

To run this example:

    (1) Set your app credentials in config.yaml
    (2) Run `python authorization_code_grant.py`
    (3) A success message will print, 'Hello {YOUR_NAME}'
    (4) User OAuth 2.0 credentials are recorded in
        'oauth2_session_store.yaml'
